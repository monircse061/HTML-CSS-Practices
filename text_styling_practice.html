		In 1968, Engelbart and his staff put on the so-called “mother of all demos” at a major conference in San Francisco, showing off all the features they had developed over the years. For 90 minutes, the stunned audience of over 1,000 computer professionals witnessed many of the features of modern computing for the first time: live videoconferencing, document sharing, word processing, windows, and a strange pointing device jokingly referred to as “the mouse.” Elements on the screen linked to other elements using associative links—or “hypertext.”

Engelbart's lifelong goal was to make computers into tools that would augment human intelligence for solving universal problems. His lab pioneered the mouse, multiple windows, and networking. We're celebrating the 50th anniversary with newly released interviews by journalist John Markoff and a number of events exploring the ongoing impact and lessons learned from Engelbart's historic demo.
